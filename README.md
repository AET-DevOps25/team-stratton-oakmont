# üìñ TUM Study Planner

Planning a study program at TUM can be overwhelming. Students often struggle with:

- **Information Overload**: Navigating through hundreds of courses across different departments and semesters
- **Complex Prerequisites**: Understanding which courses need to be completed before others
- **Planning Uncertainty**: Not knowing which courses align with their career goals or interests
- **Time Management**: Organizing courses efficiently across semesters to graduate on time
- **Lack of Guidance**: Limited access to personalized academic advice when needed

Our TUM Study Planner solves these challenges by providing an intelligent, all-in-one platform that guides students through their entire academic journey.

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Student Registration

Getting started is effortless. Students create an account using their email and a password ‚Äì that‚Äôs it. From there, they‚Äôre welcomed to explore the course catalog, create study plans and get AI-Powered assistance.

#### üîç Explore Course Catalog

No more getting lost in PDFs or scattered links. Our platform offers a powerful, searchable catalog of all TUM courses (currently only MSc Information System courses), neatly organized by programs and departments. Whether you‚Äôre curious about Machine Learning, Algorithms, or Digital Ethics, students can search intuitively, filter by requirements, and dive into module details: credits, prerequisites, semesters offered, and more. The entire academic landscape is just a few clicks away.

#### üìö Smart Study Plan Creation

Building a degree plan has never been easier. Students can design their own semester-by-semester roadmap, check off prerequisites, and monitor progress toward graduation ‚Äì all visually and interactively. Multiple study plan scenarios? Absolutely. Real-time validation ensures every plan is realistic, rule-compliant, and tailored to each student‚Äôs goals.

#### ü§ñ AI-Powered Course Assistance

Meet your 24/7 academic co-pilot. Our AI assistant understands TUM‚Äôs curriculum and gives intelligent answers in natural language:
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between the two Machine Learning electives?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat path should I take if I want to become a data scientist?‚Äù
Backed by deep content analysis and confidence scores, the AI suggests optimal course sequences, explains prerequisites, and helps students plan smarter.

## ü§ñ GenAI Integration

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

The system implements a sophisticated RAG architecture for intelligent course assistance:

#### Core AI Capabilities

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parse complex student queries about academic planning
- **Semantic Course Search**: Vector-based similarity search across TUM course catalog
- **Contextual Response Generation**: GPT-powered responses with course-specific context
- **Course Code Detection**: Automatic identification and linking of course references
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability assessment for AI-generated responses

#### Technical Implementation

    D --> E[Context Retrieval<br/>PostgreSQL]
    E --> F[LLM Generation<br/>GPT-4]
    F --> G[Response + Confidence<br/>+ Course Links]
```

#### Example AI Interactions

- **"What programming languages are used in IN0001?"** ‚Üí Identifies course, retrieves content, provides specific language information
- **"I want to study machine learning. What courses should I take?"** ‚Üí Multi-course recommendations with prerequisites and sequences
- **"What are the prerequisites for Advanced Algorithms?"** ‚Üí Prerequisite analysis with academic planning guidance
